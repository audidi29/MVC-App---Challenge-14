# MVC - App Challenge 14

In this project, I was asking to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well.

## User Stories

* As a deveoper who writes about tech
 
 I want a CMS-style blog site

 So that I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions

## Challenge

The challenge in this project was to setting up my sql server. I spend a lot of time trying to figure it out why I couldn't installed it properly (since I had it before but got some technical issue). Also I got an issue deploying the app through Heroku. It was long and challenging but definetely worth it since I learned a lot. The application did not working perfectly, but I will keep working on it.

## Usage

npm start
node server.js 
To run the server and open the app
